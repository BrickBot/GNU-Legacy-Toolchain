Description: Upstream changes introduced in version 1:3.4.6-6
 This patch has been created by dpkg-source during the package build.
 Here's the last changelog entry, hopefully it gives details on why
 those changes were made:
 .
 gcc-h8300-hms (1:3.4.6-6) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * Switch to dpkg-source 3.0 (quilt) format
   * Bumped Standards-Version (no changes)
   * New compat level is 5
   * Dropped all versions on depens as even oldstable has sufficiently recent
     ones; added ${misc:Depends}; cleanup of description
   * Force SHELL to /bin/sh for configure (closes: #607486)
 .
